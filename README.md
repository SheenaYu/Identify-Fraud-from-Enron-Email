# Udacity-DAND_Project5
5th project of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree: Identify Fraud from Enron Email.

In this project, I play detective and put my machine learning skills to use by building an algorithm to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset.
